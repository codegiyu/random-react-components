# Giyu's Random React Components

This is a collection of random components built with react typescript. It is open to contributions from the Coder's Den community at least.

You can drop a request with the necessary pics, vids, or links in the Coder's Den whatsapp group for a particular component to be built and someone will attend to that.

A particular structure hasn't been put in place concerning handling new requests anyway, but we'll work that out as we go along.

Of course, if you have nice components you've built yourself in your own projects, you're very welcome to create your branch and drop your code for those components here.

There are currently no particular conventions for branch naming here.

However there are three automated checks on push to any branch:

- Build check `npm run build`
- Eslint lint check `npm run lint`
- Prettier format check `npm run format:check`

You are advised to run these commands yourself before pushing to ensure they will pass the checks on github.

Happy collaboration y'allðŸ‘Œ
